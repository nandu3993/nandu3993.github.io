# NerdHerd

![alt text](../assets/images/nerdherd/image.png)

We can see some interesting ports open. Port 21 (FTP) allows anonymous login. Before exploring the website, let's collect information from the FTP service.

I downloaded the files from the FTP server. However, running exiftool on them did not reveal much information, except for a possible username.

Next, let's explore the web page.

![alt text](<../assets/images/nerdherd/image copy 2.png>)
![alt text](<../assets/images/nerdherd/image copy 3.png>)

We can see there is an `/admin` directory, which could be useful.

![alt text](<../assets/images/nerdherd/image copy 4.png>)

Logging in or registering as a user does not work, so the only information we can gather here is:

![alt text](<../assets/images/nerdherd/image copy 5.png>)

This encoded text is a rabbit hole.

The only owner name we know is:

```fijbxslz```

I used `enum4linux` to enumerate further.

![alt text](image-2.png)
![alt text](<../assets/images/nerdherd/image copy 9.png>)

We can see a username: `chuck`  
And a shared folder: `nerdherd_classified`

All we need now is a password. I tried brute-forcing, but had no luck.

I was stuck here for a while, so I checked Discord for a hint. The decryption key for `fijbxslz` turned out to be `birdistheword`.

![alt text](<../assets/images/nerdherd/image copy 10.png>)

**Username:** chuck  
**Password:** easypass

Now, let's try logging into the SMB shares.

![alt text](<../assets/images/nerdherd/image copy 11.png>)

After downloading the file, we find:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/tryhackme/tmp]
└─$ cat secr3t.txt                          
Ssssh! don't tell this anyone because you deserved it this far:

    check out "/this1sn0tadirect0ry"

Sincerely,
    0xpr0N3rd
<3
```

So, we have a directory to check.

![alt text](<../assets/images/nerdherd/image copy 12.png>)

We find new credentials:  
`chuck : th1s41ntmypa5s`

This gives us the SSH password.

```bash
──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/tryhackme/tmp]
└─$ ssh chuck@10.201.69.156
chuck@10.201.69.156's password:

We have obtained the user flag!

I then uploaded LinPEAS to the machine to continue with privilege escalation.
