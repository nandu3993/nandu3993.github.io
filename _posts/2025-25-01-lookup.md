![alt text](<../assets/images/lookup/Screenshot 2025-01-25 093145.png>)

inorder to load the site add lookup.thm to /etc/hosts

```<ip> lookup.thm```

![alt text](<../assets/images/lookup/Screenshot 2025-01-25 094237.png>)

![alt text](<../assets/images/lookup/Screenshot 2025-01-25 103232.png>)

So we can load the site

run a directory scan

cant find anything
so try some common credentials
![alt text](<../assets/images/lookup/Screenshot 2025-01-25 104442.png>)

the replay says wrong password so i found one user name which is 'admin'

next is to find a password
![alt text](<../assets/images/lookup/Screenshot 2025-01-25 105534.png>)

i used hydra and found out the password
```password123```

when we try admin username and the given password it wont work so there will be some other username is there
try to find it with the same password. i used ffuf to find the username

```jose:password123```
we got the credentials to login

when we try to login is shows another domin name

add this to etc/hosts

search for the exploit associated with it

Better to use msfconsole to do this
![alt text](<../assets/images/lookup/Screenshot 2025-01-25 113834.png>)


exploit it
![alt text](<../assets/images/lookup/Screenshot 2025-01-25 114410.png>)

![alt text](<../assets/images/lookup/Screenshot 2025-01-25 154950.png>)

use this to get the list of passwords for the user think

![alt text](<../assets/images/lookup/Screenshot 2025-01-25 155025.png>)

bruteforce ssh with this password
![alt text](<../assets/images/lookup/Screenshot 2025-01-25 155313.png>)

got the username and password
get the userflag

![alt text](<../assets/images/lookup/Screenshot 2025-01-25 155641.png>)
